Question

1 How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?

about 5 hours 

2 We redesigned the file system this year with the goal of making it more comprehensible in a week-long lab. Do you feel like you gained an understanding of how to build a file system? Feel free to suggest things we could improve.

Yes, I did. But I think it is too simple to write only such few things. One may not gain a whole sence about how jos fs working.
